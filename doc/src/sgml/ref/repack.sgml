  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   <command>REPACK</command> reclaims storage occupied by dead
   tuples. Unlike <command>VACUUM</command>, it does so by rewriting the
   entire contents of the table specified
   by <replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable> into a new disk
   file with no extra space (except for the space guaranteed by
   the <literal>fillfactor</literal> storage parameter), allowing unused space
   to be returned to the operating system.
  </para>

  <para>
   Without
   a <replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable>, <command>REPACK</command>
   processes every table and materialized view in the current database that
   the current user has the <literal>MAINTAIN</literal> privilege on. This
   form of <command>REPACK</command> cannot be executed inside a transaction
   block.
  </para>

  <para>
   If a <literal>USING INDEX</literal> clause is specified, the rows are
   physically reordered based on information from an index.  Please see the
   notes on clustering below.
  </para>

  <para>
   When a table is being repacked, an <literal>ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</literal> lock
   is acquired on it. This prevents any other database operations (both reads
   and writes) from operating on the table until the <command>REPACK</command>
   is finished.
  </para>

   <title>Notes on Clustering</title>

   <para>
    If the <literal>USING INDEX</literal> clause is specified, the rows in
    the table are physically reordered following an index: if an index name
    is specified in the command, then that index is used; if no index name
    is specified, then the index that has been configured as the index to
    cluster on.  If no index has been configured in this way, an error is
    thrown.  The index given in the <literal>USING INDEX</literal> clause
    is configured as the index to cluster on, as well as an index given
    to the <command>CLUSTER</command> command.  An index can be set
    manually using <command>ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER ON</command>, and reset
    with <command>ALTER TABLE ... SET WITHOUT CLUSTER</command>.
   </para>

   <para>
    If no table name is specified in <command>REPACK USING INDEX</command>,
    all tables which have a clustering index defined and which the calling
    user has privileges for are processed.
   </para>

   <para>
    Clustering is a one-time operation: when the table is
    subsequently updated, the changes are not clustered.  That is, no attempt
    is made to store new or updated rows according to their index order.  (If
    one wishes, one can periodically recluster by issuing the command again.
    Also, setting the table's <literal>fillfactor</literal> storage parameter
    to less than 100% can aid in preserving cluster ordering during updates,
    since updated rows are kept on the same page if enough space is available
    there.)
   </para>

   <para>
    In cases where you are accessing single rows randomly within a table, the
    actual order of the data in the table is unimportant. However, if you tend
    to access some data more than others, and there is an index that groups
    them together, you will benefit from using clustering.  If
    you are requesting a range of indexed values from a table, or a single
    indexed value that has multiple rows that match,
    <command>REPACK</command> will help because once the index identifies the
    table page for the first row that matches, all other rows that match are
    probably already on the same table page, and so you save disk accesses and
    speed up the query.
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>REPACK</command> can re-sort the table using either an index scan
    on the specified index (if the index is a b-tree), or a sequential scan
    followed by sorting.  It will attempt to choose the method that will be
    faster, based on planner cost parameters and available statistical
    information.
   </para>

   <para>
    Because the planner records statistics about the ordering of tables, it is
    advisable to
    run <link linkend="sql-analyze"><command>ANALYZE</command></link> on the
    newly repacked table.  Otherwise, the planner might make poor choices of
    query plans.
   </para>

   <title>Notes on Resources</title>

   <para>
    When an index scan or a sequential scan without sort is used, a temporary
    copy of the table is created that contains the table data in the index
    order.  Temporary copies of each index on the table are created as well.
    Therefore, you need free space on disk at least equal to the sum of the
    table size and the index sizes.
   </para>

   <para>
    When a sequential scan and sort is used, a temporary sort file is also
    created, so that the peak temporary space requirement is as much as double
    the table size, plus the index sizes.  This method is often faster than
    the index scan method, but if the disk space requirement is intolerable,
    you can disable this choice by temporarily setting
    <xref linkend="guc-enable-sort"/> to <literal>off</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    It is advisable to set <xref linkend="guc-maintenance-work-mem"/> to a
    reasonably large value (but not more than the amount of RAM you can
    dedicate to the <command>REPACK</command> operation) before repacking.

  <title>Notes</title>

   <para>
    To repack a table, one must have the <literal>MAINTAIN</literal> privilege
    on the table.
   </para>

   <para>
    While <command>REPACK</command> is running, the <xref
    linkend="guc-search-path"/> is temporarily changed to <literal>pg_catalog,
    pg_temp</literal>.
   </para>

  <para>
    Each backend running <command>REPACK</command> will report its progress
    in the <structname>pg_stat_progress_repack</structname> view. See
    <xref linkend="repack-progress-reporting"/> for details.
  </para>

   <para>
    Repacking a partitioned table repacks each of its partitions. If an index
    is specified, each partition is repacked using the partition of that
    index. <command>REPACK</command> on a partitioned table cannot be executed
    inside a transaction block.
   </para>

  <title>Examples</title>

  <para>
   Repack the table <literal>employees</literal>:
<programlisting>
REPACK employees;
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Repack the table <literal>employees</literal> on the basis of its
   index <literal>employees_ind</literal> (Since index is used here, this is
   effectively clustering):
<programlisting>
REPACK employees USING INDEX employees_ind;
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Repack the table <literal>cases</literal> on physical ordering,
   running an <command>ANALYZE</command> on the given columns once
   repacking is done, showing informational messages:
<programlisting>
REPACK (ANALYZE, VERBOSE) cases (district, case_nr);
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Repack all tables in the database on which you have
   the <literal>MAINTAIN</literal> privilege:
<programlisting>
REPACK;
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Repack all tables for which a clustering index has previously been
   configured on which you have the <literal>MAINTAIN</literal> privilege,
   showing informational messages:
<programlisting>
REPACK (VERBOSE) USING INDEX;
</programlisting>
  </para>
